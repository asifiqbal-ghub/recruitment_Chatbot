## Overview

This project is a recruitment chatbot that scans open positions, manages candidates, and tracks recruiter performance. It assists hiring teams by automating candidate intake, matching candidates to roles, scheduling interviews, and reporting recruiting metrics.

## Features

- Scan and index open positions from a jobs source
- Candidate intake and profile management
- Candidate-role matching and ranking
- Interview scheduling and notifications
- Recruiter performance tracking and reporting
- Exportable reports and metrics
- Configurable rules for screening and workflow

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd recruitment_Chatbot
```

2.(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash

# Windows PowerShell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# or Command Prompt
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

## Usage

## Data

Candidate data is typically stored under a `data/` folder (create it if not present). Below is a sample table of candidate information.

| Name | Position | Status |
| ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| Aisha Gupta | Software Engineer | Screening |
| Rohan Sharma | Data Scientist | Interview Scheduled |
| Neha Kapoor | Frontend Developer | Offer Extended |

(If you have a different data storage method—database, CSV, or external ATS—update the `data/` reference accordingly.)

## Results

Sample metrics (examples of what the chatbot reports):

| Metric | Example Value |
|--------|---------------|
| Total candidates processed | 124 |
| Offers made | 9 |
| Average recruitment time | 21 days |
